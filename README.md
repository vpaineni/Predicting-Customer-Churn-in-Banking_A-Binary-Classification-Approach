# Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-Banking_A-Binary-Classification-Approach

# Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the banking sector, where retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to predict customer churn using binary classification techniques, helping financial institutions proactively identify at-risk customers and take preventive measures.

We leverage multiple machine learning algorithms to classify customers as likely to churn or not churn, based on historical banking data. The models are evaluated on various performance metrics to determine the most effective approach for this dataset.

# Machine Learning Models Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Decision Tree Classifier
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
6. XGBoost

# Performance Evaluation Metrics
To ensure model reliability and effectiveness, we assess each model using the following key metrics:
1. Accuracy
2. Cross-Validation Score
3. ROC-AUC Score
4. Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
5. Confusion Matrix

These metrics help in comparing model performance, determining trade-offs between false positives and false negatives, and selecting the most accurate model for predicting customer churn.

# Dataset
The dataset includes customer transaction history, demographics, and account-related features that influence churn.
Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization have been applied to improve model performance.

# Project Workflow
# 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, feature selection)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering

# 2. Model Training & Evaluation
- Implementing multiple classification models
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluating models on test data

# 3. Results Analysis & Model Selection
- Comparing models based on performance metrics
- Selecting the most effective model for deployment

# How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
